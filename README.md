## How was the animation made:
  - Used a drawing program(Krita in this case).
  - Painted 2 lines of 16 5x8 blocks, representing a block in the display.
  - Animated inside the program a 5-frame loop to facilitate programming in the real LCD.
  - Copied the pixels of each block to the c++ progam separating in frames and after that did a loop to repeat.
